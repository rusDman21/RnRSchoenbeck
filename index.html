CEREMONY & RECEPTION

The ceremony and reception will take place at Allie’s Cabin* on Beaver Creek Mountain, in Beaver Creek Village, in Vail, Colorado. 

Offering spectacular Beaver Creek Valley views, Allie’s Cabin is located in an aspen grove on Beaver Creek Mountain. The Cabin is named after Allie Townsend, known in the 19th century as the “First Lady” of Beaver Creek. She was the widow of George Townsend, the first settler of Beaver Creek. The menu, prepared by Chef Kirk Weems, features a myriad of contemporary regional cuisine including prime aged meats, game, fish & fowl. 


In the winter, Allie’s Cabin only accessible by sleigh, so be sure to wear your snow boots and heavy coat! Not to worry, there is a boot room in the cabin where you can store your warm clothes and change into your party shoes! The sleigh will pick you up in front of Centennial Station promptly at 6:00pm. Where is Centennial Station you ask? Don’t worry! You just need to know where the Christie Lodge is! You will be picked up in front of The Christie Lodge at 5:30, and dropped off right where the sleigh will pick you up. You’ll have the same service on the way back home. Show up, sit back, and enjoy the ride -figuratively AND literally!

Transportation: 
	
Flying in? 
Guests from out of town should plan to fly in to either Denver International Airport (DEN) or Eagle County Airport (EGE).

Don’t want to drive?
We recommend Colorado Mountain Express for your trip to and from the airport. If you mention that you are in town for a wedding, and you will receive 20% off of your fare! The trip from DIA to the lodge is about 2 hours, and from EGE is about 30 minutes. Once you arrive at the Christie Lodge, there is a complimentary shuttle to and from Beaver Creek Village, Vail Mountain and around downtown Avon. There are also complimentary shuttles within each of those areas. On the day of the wedding, we will provide transportation for you to and from the wedding events. 

Up for a drive?
 If you choose to drive, parking is free at the Christie Lodge. It is about a 2 hour drive from Denver International Airport, and about a 30 minute drive from Eagle County Airport. 

From Denver International Airport: 
Follow the main road out of the airport. Join I-70 west towards “Grand Junction”. Follow I-70 west for approximately 110-120 miles to exit 167, “AVON”. Get off at exit 167 – Make a left turn (third exit) at the third main roundabout south of I-70, the one with the 4 large galloping horse sculptures in the center, and the Christie Lodge is on your left. 

From Eagle County Airport:
Turn right out of the airport area and travel east on US-6. Turn left onto Eby Creek Road. Take I-70 E towards Denver. Exit 167/Avon. Turn right at the bottom of the exit ramp. The Christie Lodge will be on the left at 47 East Beaver Creek Boulevard. Exit three-fourths of the way around the roundabout to reach the entrance.
