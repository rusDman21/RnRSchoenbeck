			<h4>Our Story</h4>
			<p class="justify">Our story begins in 2010 in a little hair salon in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago where Renee was working with Sara, Russell’s stepmom. Sara often talked to Renee about Russell, her hilarious and smart stepson who lived in Michigan. Finally, Renee’s interest was peaked, and she decided to send Russell a Facebook message. Over the next few months, Renee and Russell travelled between Michigan and Illinois, and eventually, Russell moved back to his hometown of Chicago. Russell and Renee moved in to a charming little Wicker Park apartment in May of 2012. On Friday, August 30, 2013, Russell and Renee got engaged! After much discussion and exploration, we decided to make Colorado our new home, and moved to Broomfield in April of 2014. We are so excited for our future together and can’t wait to share our special day with you!</p>

			<!-- <h4>The Proposal</h4>
			
			<p class="justify">On Friday, August 30, 2013, around 3:00, my boss announced that everyone should start the weekend early and head home. I had no idea what I would do with my afternoon, so when I texted Russell and he responded “Nice! What are you going to do? Head home?” I responded, “I don’t know! The world is my oyster!” I decided to just take my time commuting and head home. Normally, the walk from the Blue Line took about 8 minutes – but that day, I was enjoying the weather, so it took about 20. When I arrived at the apartment, I noticed that the door was unlocked. I opened the door, panicked a little, and said “HELLO??” No one answered. I walked inside and was sure I was going to be attacked. I felt that panic for about 20 seconds, until I noticed that music was on and the dishes were done. From behind me, I heard “Hello!” and I turned around and Russell was there. He told me he had a very busy day and suggested we go outside to the backyard. Our apartment had a beautiful garden in the back, and when we walked out I noticed there were flowers and bottles of wine waiting. I immediately started to cry and I’m not even sure if he fully got the words “will you marry me” out before I started screaming “YES!” One of my most favorite things about the day (there are many) was that we kept the moment private for a few hours. We didn’t rush to tell anyone. We opened a bottle of wine, had some drinks, went to dinner, and just reveled in our own excitement for a bit. It was amazing. When we finally started sharing the news, it was so fun to enjoy other people’s excitement! I love Russell so much, he is everything I have ever wanted in a husband, and I am so excited to be his wife!</p> -->

			<p>The ceremony and reception will both take place at Allie’s Cabin on Beaver Creek Mountain.</p>
			<p>Set amidst a peaceful aspen grove, Allie's Cabin offers fine dining with spectacular views of Beaver Creek Village and the surrounding valley. The cabin is named after Allie Townsend who was known in the 19th century as the "First Lady" of Beaver Creek. She was the widow of George Townsend, the first settler of Beaver Creek.</p>
			<p>The menu features a myriad of contemporary regional cuisine including prime aged meats, game, fish and fowl. The cabin is hewn from stacked, rough-sawn timber with mountain-style architecture, and features a large, sunny deck adjacent to a quaint bar. The interior is cozy and welcoming, complete with rustic wooden tables, an eclectic collection of fixtures, and furniture evocative of the era in which Allie lived.</p>

				<li>5:45 – Sleigh ride up to Allie’s Cabin</li>

			<h4>Transportation</h4>
			<h5>Flying in?</h5>
			<p>Guests from out of town should plan to fly in to either Denver International Airport (DEN) or Eagle County Airport (EGE).</p>
			<h5>Don’t want to drive?</h5>
			<p>We recommend Colorado Mountain Express for your trip to and from the airport. Mention that you are in town for a wedding and receive 20% off of your fare! The trip from DIA to the lodge is about 2 hours, and from EGE is about 30 minutes. Once you arrive at The Christie Lodge, there is a complimentary shuttle to and from Beaver Creek Village, Vail Mountain and around downtown Avon. There are also complimentary shuttles within each of those areas. On the day of the wedding, we will provide transportation for you to and from the wedding events.</p>
			<h5>Up for a drive?</h5>
			<p>If you choose to drive, parking is free at the Christie Lodge. It is about a 2 hour drive from Denver International Airport, and about a 30 minute drive from Eagle County Airport. </p>
			<h6>From Denver International Airport: </h6>
			<p>Follow the main road out of the airport. Join I-70 west towards “Grand Junction”. Follow I-70 west for approximately 110-120 miles to exit 167, “AVON”. Get off at exit 167 – Make a left turn (third exit) at the third main roundabout south of I-70, the one with the 4 large galloping horse sculptures in the center, and the Christie Lodge is on your left. </p>
			<h6>From Eagle County Airport:</h6>
			<p>Turn right out of the airport area and travel east on US-6. Turn left onto Eby Creek Road. Take I-70 E towards Denver. Exit 167/Avon. Turn right at the bottom of the exit ramp. The Christie Lodge will be on the left at 47 East Beaver Creek Boulevard. Exit three-fourths of the way around the roundabout to reach the entrance. </p>
