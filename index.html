		<article id="transportation">Transportation: 
					
				Flying in? 
				Guests from out of town should plan to fly in to either Denver International Airport (DEN) or Eagle County Airport (EGE).
		
				Don’t want to drive?
				We recommend Colorado Mountain Express for your trip to and from the airport. Mention that you are in town for a wedding and receive 20% off of your fare! The trip from DIA to the lodge is about 2 hours, and from EGE is about 30 minutes. Once you arrive at The Christie Lodge, there is a complimentary shuttle to and from Beaver Creek Village, Vail Mountain and around downtown Avon. There are also complimentary shuttles within each of those areas. On the day of the wedding, we will provide transportation for you to and from the wedding events. 
		
				Up for a drive?
				If you choose to drive, parking is free at the Christie Lodge. It is about a 2 hour drive from Denver International Airport, and about a 30 minute drive from Eagle County Airport. 
		
				From Denver International Airport: 
				Follow the main road out of the airport. Join I-70 west towards “Grand Junction”. Follow I-70 west for approximately 110-120 miles to exit 167, “AVON”. Get off at exit 167 – Make a left turn (third exit) at the third main roundabout south of I-70, the one with the 4 large galloping horse sculptures in the center, and the Christie Lodge is on your left. 
		
				From Eagle County Airport:
				Turn right out of the airport area and travel east on US-6. Turn left onto Eby Creek Road. Take I-70 E towards Denver. Exit 167/Avon. Turn right at the bottom of the exit ramp. The Christie Lodge will be on the left at 47 East Beaver Creek Boulevard. Exit three-fourths of the way around the roundabout to reach the entrance. </article>
